pg_testenv.py
===============

Helper script for creating a completely standalone postgresql server instance
inside python or via the command line. Can be used for automatic testing,
etc. where a fully featured PostgreSQL is needed.

Depends on postgresql global installation.
Tested on Ubuntu with latest PGDG repository versions for 9.1 and 9.3.
